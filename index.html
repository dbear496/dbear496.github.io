<strong>About me:</strong>
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. My long-term goal is to teach computer science at the university level. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech. As an undergraduate, I researched hardware acceleration for page-level memory compression with Xun (Steve) Jian as my advisor, and I co-authored the paper "Translation-optimized memory Compression for Capacity" which was accepted at MICRO 2022. My current research interests are in dataflow processors and alternative micro-architecture/ISA designs.
